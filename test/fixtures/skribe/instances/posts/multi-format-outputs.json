  "content": "Struktur's power shines when you generate multiple formats from one data source. This is where the separation of data, structure, and presentation pays off massively.\n\nSkribe's blog posts are instances—JSON objects with title, date, content, tags. From these same instances, we generate:\n- **HTML pages** via templates/layouts/blog-post.html\n- **RSS feed** via mixins/rss/templates/feed.xml\n- **Tag index pages** via templates/layouts/tag.html\n- **Homepage listing** via templates/index.html\n\nOne data source, four output formats. Each template queries the canonical data structure but renders it differently. The HTML template formats content for reading. The RSS template wraps it in XML with publication dates. The tag pages filter by taxonomy. The homepage shows summaries.\n\nWant to add more formats? Create more templates:\n- **JSON API endpoint** (templates/api.json) for client-side apps\n- **Sitemap.xml** (templates/sitemap.xml) for SEO\n- **Search index** (templates/search.json) for client-side search\n- **PDF exports** (templates with a PDF rendering tool)\n- **Markdown exports** (templates that output .md files)\n\nEach template is independent. They all query the same canonical data but render however they want. This is **write-once, render-everywhere** at its best. Your content stays in one place. Your outputs scale infinitely. Change a blog post's title? All formats update automatically.\n\nCompare this to traditional static site generators where content is tied to a specific output format. Markdown files become HTML. Want RSS? Hope the generator has a plugin. Want JSON? Write custom code. With Struktur, every output is just another template querying validated data. The data layer is format-agnostic. The template layer handles presentation. Clean separation of concerns."
