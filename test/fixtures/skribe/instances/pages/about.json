Skribe demonstrates how Struktur's class/instance/template pattern can build real-world applications beyond infrastructure configuration. Every page you see here\u2014including the individual blog posts\u2014is generated from structured JSON data validated against schemas and rendered through Handlebars templates.\n\nWhat makes Skribe interesting is that it uses Struktur's file helper to generate multiple HTML files from a single template. The index.html template doesn't just render the homepage\u2014it iterates over all blog posts and pages, generating individual files for each one. This shows how templates can be generative, not just decorative. All of this happens deterministically: same input data produces identical output every time, making builds auditable and diffable.\n\nSkribe proves that Struktur isn't limited to DevOps or infrastructure domains. Any structured content\u2014documentation, catalogs, reports, or sites like this\u2014can benefit from schema validation, inheritance, and deterministic rendering. The result is a build pipeline that catches errors early, composes cleanly, and outputs exactly what you expect."
