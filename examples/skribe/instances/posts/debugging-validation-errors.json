      "content": "Validation errors can be cryptic at first. You add a new blog post, run the build, and boom: 'Validation failed'. Where's the problem? What broke? Here's the systematic approach.\n\n**Step 1: Read the error message.** Struktur tries to be clear. 'Required field date missing in instance blog_post.my-new-post' tells you exactly what's wrong and where. The instance path points to the file, the schema path points to the rule. Start there.\n\n**Step 2: Check build/meta/validation.json.** This is the full error report with all details. It shows the instance data, the schema rule that failed, and the specific path through nested objects. If the console error is truncated, this file has the complete context.\n\n**Step 3: Common culprits.** In my experience, most validation errors fall into a few categories:\n- **Required fields missing**: You forgot to add a field the schema requires. Add it.\n- **Wrong types**: You put a string where a number is expected, or vice versa. Check your quotes.\n- **Extra fields**: You have `additionalProperties: false` in the schema and typed a field name wrong. Check for typos.\n- **Enum violations**: The field only accepts specific values and you used something else. Check the schema's enum list.\n\n**Step 4: The --no-warnings-as-errors flag.** By default, Struktur treats warnings as errors. This is good for production but annoying during development. Use `--no-warnings-as-errors` to see ALL validation issues at once, then fix them in batch. Way faster than the fix-one-rebuild-find-another cycle.\n\nOver time, you'll internalize the patterns. New blog post? Don't forget date and author. New page? Don't forget menu field. The schemas train you to be consistent. That's not a bug\u2014it's a feature.",
