  "content": "Let me tell you about a bug that never happened. Someone added a new blog post, forgot to include a date, and pushed to production. Normally this would cause subtle problems—posts out of order, broken sorting, maybe a runtime error when the template tries to format the date. But in Skribe? The build failed immediately with a clear message: 'Required field date missing in instance blog_post.new-post'.\n\n**This is validation-first design.** Every class has a JSON schema that lives right next to it. The blog_post.schema.json file explicitly states: date is required, it must be a string, and it should match a date format. Before any templates run, before any files generate, Struktur validates every instance against its class schema. If something's wrong, the build stops. No partial outputs, no corrupted state, no mystery bugs in production.\n\nThe strictness feels uncomfortable at first. You'll hit validation errors as you're developing. But here's what you gain: **confidence**. By the time your templates render, you know with certainty that the data is complete and correct. Templates can assume dates exist, assume tags are arrays, assume menu values are valid. No defensive 'if date exists' checks everywhere.\n\nSkribe goes further with `additionalProperties: false` in schemas. This means typos in field names get caught instantly. Spell 'author' as 'auther'? Validation fails. This might seem pedantic, but it catches bugs that would otherwise hide in your content for months until someone notices a missing byline.\n\nIn CI/CD pipelines, this is gold. A failed build is loud and immediate. A silent failure that corrupts your site is expensive and embarrassing. Schema validation makes the difference between 'the build broke, fix it' and 'the site has been broken for three days and no one noticed'."
